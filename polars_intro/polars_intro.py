    # Data analysis in Python
    As an interpreted language with an easy-to-read syntax, Python is fantastic for data analysis, where rapid iteration enables exploration and accelerates development.

    Since its first release in 2008, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) has been the de-facto standard for data analysis in Python, but in recent years other libraries have been created which offer distinct advantages. Some of those include:

    - [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/): GPU-accelerated dataframe operations with pandas API support
    - [modin](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): pandas API running on distributed compute using [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) or [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) as a backend
    - [ibis](https://ibis-project.org/): dataframe library supporting dozens of backends (including pandas, polars, DuckDB, and many SQL databases)
    - [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/): in-process database engine for running SQL queries on local or remote data
    - [temporian](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): efficient data processing for timeseries data
    - [polars](https://pola.rs/): ultra-fast dataframe library written in Rust
    - and others...

        Polars uses the Apache Arrow in-memory data format, which is column-oriented. The primary data structures for polars are Series and DataFrames, similar to pandas.
        
        - Apache Arrow supports many useful data types (many more than those which are supported by NumPy), so you can perform fast, vectorized operations on all kinds of data (nested JSON `structs`, strings, datetimes, etc.)

        In Polars, a _context_ refers to the data available to operate on.
        
        The primary contexts are:
        
        **Selection**:
        
        - `.select()`: choose a subset of columns and perform operations on them
        - `.with_columns()`: add to the columns already available
