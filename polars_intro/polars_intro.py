        # Data analysis in Python
        As an interpreted language with an easy-to-read syntax, Python is fantastic for data analysis, where rapid iteration enables exploration and accelerates development.

        Since its first release in 2008, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) has been the de-facto standard for data analysis in Python, but in recent years other libraries have been created which offer distinct advantages. Some of those include:

        - [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/): GPU-accelerated dataframe operations with pandas API support
        - [modin](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): pandas API running on distributed compute using [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) or [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) as a backend
        - [ibis](https://ibis-project.org/): dataframe library supporting dozens of backends (including pandas, polars, DuckDB, and many SQL databases)
        - [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/): in-process database engine for running SQL queries on local or remote data
        - [temporian](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): efficient data processing for timeseries data

        # Key concepts

        Polars uses the Apache Arrow in-memory data format, which is column-oriented. The primary data structures for polars are Series and DataFrames, similar to pandas.

        Apache Arrow supports many useful data types (many more than those which are supported by NumPy), so you can perform fast, vectorized operations on all kinds of data (nested JSON `structs`, strings, datetimes, etc.)

        **Selection**:

        - `.select()`: choose a subset of columns and perform operations on them
        - `.with_columns()`: add to the columns already available

        **Filtering**:

        - `.filter()`: filter the data using boolean conditions on row values
